    <h1> Is there evidence of herding in financial markets?</h1>
    <h5> </h5>

    <p>Since the conception of Financial Markets there has oftentimes been debate over whether these markets operate efficiently and whether they do so in a manner that is congruent with the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Scholars such as Bikchandi (2000) and Spyrou (2013) have speculated that an explanation as to why Financial Markets sometimes do not operate according to this principle can oftentimes be rooted in herding behaviour. Herding occurs in finance when investors follow the crowd instead of their own analysis. Historically, it is attributable to starting large market rallies and sell offs that are often based on a lack of fundamental support to justify either. Therefore, through a series of visualisations I will show instances of herding, the effect of herding and whether herding can actually be empirically proven in less traditional markets such as the cryptocurrency market. </p>



</div>
        
        <h5> Section 1: Herding in times of uncertainty</h5>

  <p>In the field of behavioural economics scholars often stress that herding behaviour can often be attributed to causing and fuelling market crashes in finance. Thus, for my first piece of analysis I have chosen to scrutinise the most recent financial crash that was associated with the outbreak of Covid-19. Figure 1 displays the stock price of 5 major stock indexes ranging from pre to post Covid-19 outbreak. From this one is able to see that each indexes price plummets when Covid was officially declared a global pandemic in March of 2020. </p>

<p>The link to the code used to extract data from yfinance can be found <a href= "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QPiQT_KxUirwqk_-WoUgOdT1vdafVrqt">here</a></p>
        <div class = "chart" id="Chart1">
         <script>
             var myChart1 = "Graph4project_1.json";
             vegaEmbed('#Chart1', myChart1);
         </script>
        </div>
       
        <p>Although, this is not enough to discern whether herding behaviour was a driving mechanism, let alone a key driving mechanism in precipitating such a market failure. Therefore, in figure 2 I have created a graph that explores the relationship between trading volume and stock prices. I have done this as Jlassi and Bensaida (2014) note that trading volume is a key explanatory variable when identifying instances of herding. From this figure we can see that as the stock price begins to rapidly decline trading volume increases. Therefore, it can be argued that such a time of uncertainty might cause large investors to sell stocks. This might precipitate an informational cascade causing other investors to offload stocks thus fuelling a market crash. <p>

        <h5> Section 2: Herding and its effect on market volatility </h5>
        <p> The previous figures demonstrate that herding can be seen to increase irrational trade that constitutes a large price fluctuation. Attentive of this, my attention turned to markets where price fluctuations are more prominent, and volatility is more pronounced. Therefore, I decided to explore whether herding behaviour is evident in the cryptocurrency market. This being a market that is characterised by significant bullish, bearish runs and compositional uncertainty (Vladimir, 2021).<p>

<div class="chart" id="Chart2">
  <script>
    var myChart2 = "Crypto_Chart_Project.json";
    vegaEmbed('#Chart2', myChart2);
  </script>
</div>
   
 <div class="chart" id="Chart3"> 
     <script>
      
    
 var myChart3 = "Chart4_Project.json";
   
 vegaEmbed('#Chart3', myChart3);
     </script>
     </div> 
     
        <h5> Section 4: Empirically exploring the presence of herding in Cryptocurrency Markets</h5>
        <p> stata do file <a> href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewsnowdon/andrewsnowdon.github.io/main/statadofile.do">here</a>
        
     
    
     <div class ="pngchart">
          <img src = "Autocorrelation4project.png" />
         
         
  <div class ="pngchart">
      <img src = "finalregressiontable.png"/>
     
      
      <p> The regression results show that a marginal increase in absolute market returns leads to a 6 percentage point increase in the CSAD. The table also shows that the R value is 0.788 and the t-statistic is less than 0.05 which means that the regression model used is generally a good fit and can be relied upon. From this model one can therefore say that a investors in cryptocurrency markets do in display herd behaviour. </p>  
         
      <h5> Challenges in data cleaning/analysis and how i overcame them</h5> 
      
      <p> The primary source of my data was the y.finance library. I accessed this via python in the google colab environment; the code for this can be found <a href= "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QPiQT_KxUirwqk_-WoUgOdT1vdafVrqt">here</a>. I chose this as the data from this source was daily and allowed me to access a range of data in a fairly automated manner. However the code i wrote only allowed me to access one stock/currency at a time causing me to have to perform a manual merge via excel. This wasn't desirable but the process wasn't overly tiresome. The biggest challnge i faced however was merging, formatting and creating the data that was relevant to my CSAD regressions. This was also done via excel and thus meant that I had to format the data in a way that was congruent with the STATA operating system. </p>

      <p>.</p>
      <h5> Conclusions</h5>
      <p> Based off of the visualisations I have provided I can conclude that herding behaviour might in fact be present in both the respective markets analysed. It seems to be linked to investor sentiment regarding times of uncertainty and can be seen to drive large price fluctuations leading to volatility and potential market failure. However based off of the empirical analysis undertaken it seems that herding is present in the cryptocurrency market. If I were to do this again I would use a larger sample size to give more validity to my findings</p>
